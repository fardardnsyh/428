I am excited to announce that I have a blog now - tada! I've been thinking about starting one for a while now, but never really got around to it. Having a place where I can write about the things I'm working on or thinking about, was something that I wanted for a long time. I'm also hoping that this will help me to get better at writing and to improve my English skills.

## Technologies

This blog is build using the new static site generator [Astro](https://astro.build/). It's my first time using it for a project and I'm really impressed so far. I looked at a lot of SSGs before deciding on Astro. I wanted something that was easy to use, had a good community and was easy to deploy. Astro ticks all of those boxes. It's also really fast and has a lot of cool features. I'm really excited to see where it goes in the future.

The site itself is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Which is a great service and comes for free. Once you've connected your [Github repository](https://github.com/chlorophyllkid/blog) to Netlify, it will automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push a new commit.

Oh, and I don't use any kind of analytics, cookies or tracking. I don't care about stuff like that.

## Design

At the moment, the design is pretty basic. For now, it's good enough. But I'm looking forward to redesign this thing at least once a year, haha.
